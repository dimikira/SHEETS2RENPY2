,dimikira,Hello! I decided to redo this converter using Python this time! Hope you like it!
,dimikira,"Before I made this in javascript but... I'm just more comfy with Python, so here we are."
,dimikira,Once again you can type out your dialogue here in column C. Just make sure you're always defining a speaker.
,dimikira,Wanna add in menus? Go like this.
,menu,optionalLabel
,choice,choice one text
,dimikira,Here's outcome one-
,choice,choice 2 text
,dimikira,and outcome two!
,,
,dimikira,See that empty row right above? The one I made blue? You need that to terminate the menu! Also makes it easier to read IMO.
,dimikira,Same goes for If-statements!
,if,condition_one
,dimikira,value one text
,elif,condition_two
,dimikira,value two text
,else,
,dimikira,value three text
,,
,dimikira,Tadaa~! All done!
,dimikira,Just export to CSV and let the code do the rest. :)
,,#and yes comments work as well ~
,,#it doesnt do everything but it pretty good right?
